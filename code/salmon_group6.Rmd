Summary:

This report provides an overview of adult salmon passage at the Willamette Falls fish ladder, for three species of fish (Coho, Jack-Coho, and Steelhead) observed at Willamette River in Oregon from 2001 - 2010 (Columbia River DART). Specifically, a static graph, seasonplot, and line plot of annual counts are used to explore how the fish populations are changing over the given timeframe.

**Figure 2.** Seasonal plot for salmon passage counts for 3 species (Coho, Jack-Coho, and Steelhead). Fish counts were measured from 2001-2010. Data: Columbia River DART.

#### Summary

- Coho salmon runs tend to peak around October, and the magnitude of the peak has increased over time.
- Jack Coho salmon runs also tend to peak around October, and the magnitude of the peak has increased over time.
- Steelhead salmon runs don't appear to have a clear peak, but most of the counts appear before August.

### Annual counts

```{r}
# Group by year and count for each species
spp_date <- fish_sub %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(species, wt = count) 

# Creating a plot to visualize annual counts of the three species

ggplot(data = spp_date, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5, aes(color = species)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("mediumpurple3","cyan4","coral"), 
                     name = "Fish species") +
  labs(title = "Annual fish counts by species (2001-2010)",
       x = "Year", y = "Number of fish counts") +

**Figure 3.** Coho, Jack-Coho, and Steelhead fish counts, measured by time (years) from 2001-2010. Purple (Coho), teal (Jack-Coho) and coral (Steelhead) lines indicate total annual counts per species. Data: Columbia River DART.

#### Summary

- Jack-Coho fish counts remained relatively stable over time from 2001 through 2010.
- Steelhead fish counts seemed to fluctuate but showed an overall decreasing trend until the end of the timeframe. 
- Coho fish counts fluctuated until 2008, where they increased sharply, then began dropping again in 2009.
- Both Coho and Steelhead species showed an increase around 2008-2009, indicating that an event may have occurred during this time leading to the increase.
