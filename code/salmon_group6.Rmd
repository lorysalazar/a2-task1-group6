Summary:

This report provides an overview of adult salmon passage at the Willamette Falls fish ladder, for three species of fish (Coho, Jack-Coho, and Steelhead) observed at Willamette River in Oregon from 2001 to 2010 (Columbia River DART). The first plot, a static time series graph explores overall pasage counts by species. Second, a seasonplot examines how species passage counts vary by month for each year from 2001 to 2010. The final plot shows annual counts by species in order to look specifically at trends in annual abundance of the three species over the time period.

**Figure 1.** Time series plot of adult passage counts for three salmon species, coho, jack coho, and steelhead at the Wilamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River in Oregon.

Summary
- Coho salmon passage appears to be seasonal, with strong peaks occurring at regular intervals in each year, with peaks seeming to trend upward.
- Jack coho salmon also appear to have strong seasonal peaks, at similar times in the year as coho salmon. From this plot, there does not appear to be a strong trend in changes in counts.
- Steelhead salmon also had seasonal peaks, though there were more fluctuations consistently between large peaks. From this plot, there is no clear discernible trend.


### Seasonplots

```{r}
# Creating a seasonplot for each species

coho_season <- coho_ts %>% 
  gg_season(y = count) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Coho",
       x = "month")

jack_coho_season <- jack_coho_ts %>% 
  gg_season(y = count) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Jack Coho",
       x = "month")


steelhead_season <- steelhead_ts %>% 
  gg_season(y = count) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Steelhead",
       x = "month")


patchwork <- (coho_season / jack_coho_season / steelhead_season) +
  plot_layout(guides = 'collect')

patchwork + plot_annotation(
  title = "Adult salmon passage at the Willamette Falls fish ladder, 2001 - 2010",
  caption = "Data: Columbia River DART"

**Figure 2.** Seasonal plot for salmon passage counts at the Willamette Falls fish ladder in Oregon. Passage counts of 3 species (Coho, Jack-Coho, and Steelhead) were measured from 2001-2010. Data: Columbia River DART.

#### Summary

- Coho salmon runs tend to peak around October, and the magnitude of the peak has increased over time.
- Jack Coho salmon runs also tend to peak around October, and the magnitude of the peak has increased over time.
- Steelhead salmon runs don't appear to have a clear peak, but most of the counts appear before August.

### Annual counts

```{r}
# Group by year and count for each species
spp_date <- fish_sub %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(species, wt = count) 

# Creating a plot to visualize annual counts of the three species

ggplot(data = spp_date, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5, aes(color = species)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("mediumpurple3","cyan4","coral"), 
                     name = "Fish species") +
  labs(title = "Annual fish counts by species (2001-2010)",
       x = "Year", y = "Number of fish counts") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2001:2010)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.87, 0.82))
```

**Figure 3.** Coho, Jack-Coho, and Steelhead fish counts, measured by time (years) from 2001-2010. Purple (Coho), teal (Jack-Coho) and coral (Steelhead) lines indicate total annual counts per species. Data: Columbia River DART.

#### Summary

- Jack-Coho fish counts remained relatively stable over time from 2001 through 2010.
- Steelhead fish counts seemed to fluctuate but showed an overall decreasing trend until the end of the timeframe. 
- Coho fish counts fluctuated until 2008, where they increased sharply, then began dropping again in 2009.
- Both Coho and Steelhead species showed an increase around 2008-2009, indicating that an event may have occurred during this time leading to the increase.
